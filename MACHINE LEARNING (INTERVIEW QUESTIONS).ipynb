    "3) Recursive feature elimination:- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a feature selection technique that uses a machine learning algorithm.

    "4) Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):- It is a statistical measure used to detect multicollinearity in regression analysis, and it can also be used as a feature selection technique in certain cases.
