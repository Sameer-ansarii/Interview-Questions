    "\n",

    "1) Correlation matrix: Calculate the correlation between each feature and the target variable, and select the features with the highest correlation values. Features with low correlation may not be relevant to the model and can be dropped.\n",

    "3) Recursive feature elimination:- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a feature selection technique that uses a machine learning algorithm.

    " What is K-Means Clustering and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups or clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm works by partitioning the dataset into K clusters, where K is the number of clusters specified by the user. The clusters are created by minimizing the sum of the squared distance between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to their nearest centroid, recalculates the centroids, and repeats until the centroids no longer move or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Means Clustering algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the number of clusters, K.\n",
    "Initialize K centroids randomly.\n",
    "Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, creating K clusters.\n",
    "Calculate the centroid of each cluster.\n",
    "Repeat steps 3-4 until the centroids no longer move or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "The quality of the clustering is measured using the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which represents the sum of the squared distance between each data point and its assigned centroid. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the WCSS by creating clusters that are compact and well-separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering is widely used for a variety of applications, including market segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection. However, it is important to note that the performance of the algorithm can be sensitive to the choice of K and the initial random centroids, and it may not work well for all types of data. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the clustering results using external validation metrics and to try different values of K and initialization methods.\n",
