    "Q) What is DBSCAN clustering algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "* DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning to make clusters of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "* The algorithm make clusters on the basis of density value given by user. Density value means epsilon value which also known as the radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* DBSCAN takes two main parameters: epsilon (Îµ) and minimum points (MinPts). Epsilon is the radius around each point and (MinPts) is the minimum number of data points required to form a cluster which are present in the circle of epsilon.\n",
